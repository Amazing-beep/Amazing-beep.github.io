For this assignment, you will create a personal resume website using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site should showcase your skills, experience, education, and projects in a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate, and mobile-friendly format.

Requirements:
The site must be fully responsive, adapting layout and content for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Use media queries and relative units like EM or percentages.
The resume content should be accurate and up-to-date, including your skills, work experience, education, projects, and contact info.
Incorporate custom CSS styles without using any frameworks like Bootstrap. Get creative with colors, fonts, and layouts!
Include interactivity using JavaScript. This could be a responsive:
navbar,
form validations,
image sliders,
modals,
etc.
Deploy the site on GitHub pages and submit the URL.
The site must validate without errors and function properly on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
Comment your code properly and use semantic HTML tags.
Site content and design should be unique and not copied from templates.
This resume site is a summative assessment for this module and will be graded based on requirements, creativity, and code quality. The goal is to demonstrate your HTML/CSS/JS skills by building a professional, responsive personal website that will showcase your abilities to potential employers or anyone who you network with.
